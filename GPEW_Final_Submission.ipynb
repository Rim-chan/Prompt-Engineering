              "'Derzeit werden im Bereich der genetischen Gesundheitsbewertung von Haustieren vor allem Einzeltests und rassenspezifische Produkte eingesetzt. Diese Tests sind jedoch begrenzt und kÃ¶nnen nicht das gesamte genetische Markup eines Tieres untersuchen. Unser Projekt zielt darauf ab, diese LÃ¼cke zu schlieÃen und eine innovative Methode einzufÃ¼hren, die auf dem Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) basiert. Durch die Anwendung von NGS kÃ¶nnen wir das gesamte Genom eines Tieres analysieren und genetische Varianten wie Insertionen, Deletionen und Inversionen identifizieren. Unser Ziel ist es, fÃ¼r die Spezies Hund, Katze und Pferd ein umfassendes Testpaket zu entwickeln, das eine Vielzahl von Erbkrankheiten abdeckt. Wir streben an, mehr als 60 Prozent der bekannten Erbkrankheiten in jeder Spezies zu erfassen. Das Ergebnis wird ein Testkit sein, das es Tierbesitzern, ZÃ¼chtern und TierÃ¤r'"
