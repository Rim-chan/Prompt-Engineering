## About the Competition

In this prompt engineering competition, participants were tasked with leveraging the capabilities of Openai chatGPT model. The primary goal was to craft prompts that guide the model in generating project descriptions that conform to the guidelines and criteria set forth by the FRASCATI framework.

## What is FRASCATI?

FRASCATI, developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), stands as a comprehensive framework designed to define and categorize research and development (R&D) activities. This framework offers a standardized approach to classifying projects, ensuring uniformity in reporting and analysis across diverse sectors and industries.

Compliance with FRASCATI's funding requirements is of paramount importance. By adhering to these guidelines, we achieve uniformity, transparency, and comparability in the definition, categorization, and reporting of research and development (R&D) endeavors across various organizations, sectors, and countries. 

## Repository Contents

This repository serves as my own solution. Here's what you'll find:

[Materials](https://github.com/Rim-chan/Prompt-Engineering/tree/main/Materials) : This directory contains the competition's materials including the instructions and a written discussion in German that will be used to create the project description.

[GPEW_Final_Submission](https://github.com/Rim-chan/Prompt-Engineering/blob/main/GPEW_Final_Submission.ipynb) : In this Jupyter Notebook, I present my approach using Langchain and gpt-3.5-turbo, offering an alternative perspective to the chatGPT solution. Gain insights into how GPT-3.5-Turbo interpreted the prompts and skillfully aligned them with the stringent requirements of the FRASCATI framework.

[Results](https://github.com/Rim-chan/Prompt-Engineering/tree/main/Results) : Here, you'll find the final project description crafted based on the AI-generated messages.
